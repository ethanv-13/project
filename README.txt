Run tupled.py
First, you will input the number of players that are playing the tuple out game.
Next, player by player, three dice will be rolled repeatedly until the player decides to stop rolling (typing y to reroll and n to stop),
or they "tuple out," where they roll 3 of the same dice. If this happens, the player's score is set to zero
and the turn is over.
If a player rolls two of the same dice, those dice are "fixed" and now will not be rerolled with each consecutive re-roll.
